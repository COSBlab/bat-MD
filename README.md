Repository of the data needed to reproduce the Molecular Dynamics simulations of 3 different RBD-ACE2 complexes.
 All simulations have been performed using GROMACS 2020.4. The repository is organized in the following directories:

* hRBD-hACE2: data related to the simulations of the human-RBD/human-ACE2 complex;
* b103RBD-hACE2: data related to the simulations of the BANAL-103-RBD/human-ACE2 complex;
* b236RBD-hACE2: data related to the simulations of the BANAL-236-RBD/human-ACE2 complex.
